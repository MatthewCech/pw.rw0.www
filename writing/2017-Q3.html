			<h1>Gamedev PC - Q3 2017</h1>
			<hr/>
			<h2>THE PC HARDWARE</h2>
			<p>
			My thoughts on a build for a Game Dev PC Build, with a focus more towards AAA: Please note, this is not designed to exclusively play games, and has more of a workstation focus in mind, tho a lot of the recommendations are loose on purpose. These recommendation still apply fairly well to hackintosh builds, tho you're on your own there.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;OS:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Immediately set aside $125 for Windows 10. "Just using WINE" won't cut it. If you get it for cheaper, then awesome! Sorry if you like Linux - you're free to use a VM or Dual-boot of course, just realize that most game dev tools are for Windows only. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			4 cores (with 8 threads) is a reasonable minimum. At this moment, brand doesn't matter all too much. neat processors to check out: From AMD, the Ryzen 1600, the Ryzen 1700(X), and the Ryzen 1800X. From intel, the i7-7700k, the i7-7800X, and the i7-7820X. These days, it's largely just preference.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;MOTHERBOARD:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Eh, if it has an M.2 slot that runs at PCIe speeds if you're getting an M.2 Drive, and heat-sinks for the mosfets + chokes (the little black boxes by the CPU) you're fine. You'll probably want USB3 on it too.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;RAM:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			At least 2666MHz, At least 16 GB, I don't care what brand. Note: AMD CPUs like 3200+MHz @ 14ms, otherwise it'll clock to 2666MHz unless it's a higher frequency. AMD: Favor operating frequency. Intel: Favor timings.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;GPU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			NVidia GTX 1060 6GB, AMD RX580 8GB, or better. VRAM is your friend.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;STORAGE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			At least 100+ GB SSD that performs well with 4K read/write. Would recommend M.2 SSD: Samsung Evo/Pro 960, or Corsair Force MP 500 series. Refurbished 3TB HDDs go for about $85 USD, so consider that as well.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;PSU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Anything with ~200w headroom, 80+. A 600W PSU would be fine for a single-gpu system if rated for 80+ Efficiency.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Whatever floats your boat. Should probably fit the motherboard tho, and will need at least one fan :)
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h2>BEYOND THE BOX</h2>
			<p>
			Your PC setup isn't just the PC itself! It's about making use of the power of your PC. For a full setup, I recommend setting aside 25% of the budget for peripherals. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;MONITOR(S):</h4><br/>
			<p>
			1080p unless you have other reasons for different choices, probably 5ms or less refresh rate. Look for something nice and high-contrast, color accuracy helps- it's hard to go wrong with an IPS display. If you go 4k, GPU must be 1070 8GB at minimum. Can't go too wrong with Asus, Dell, or BenQ, I'm not really a monitor guy but this is something you should consider. I would recommend at least one nice monitor in a setup - However, never underestimate the usefulness of a cheap, pre-owned 1280x1024 monitor added on as an extra bit of work space tho. Do not use a TV as a monitor.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESK CHAIR:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Oh god please get something that doesn't hurt your back and provides back support, if your job is programming this will make a world of difference.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;KEYBOARD/MOUSE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			You want a decent keyboard. Doesn't matter what, gotta be comfy for YOU, doesn't matter if other people don't like its feel. The mouse is a similar story as KB. It's gotta work for you. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;HEADPHONES:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Something not dirt cheap, and preferably fully over-ear. Recommendations from 3 brands:
			<br/>
			- AKG 240, 220, or 220M - Note, these don't block noise well.
			<br/>
			- Sennheiser HD 201s or better. Hard to find a particularly bad pair of anything more expensive from this company, if you want high-end then the HD 598s or HD 600s are on point.
			<br/>
			- Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones - You  basically can't go wrong with these ever. They're durable, and are darn good all around, tho if that's a bit above budget. They'll last for ages tho.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;OTHER:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			- A plant. Reminds you that a world exists outside your desk.<br/>
			- Sticky notes. Always good to leave yourself things for when you inevitably forget.<br/>
			- Graph paper. Good for anyone in any role!<br/>
			- Pencils/Pens. <br/>
