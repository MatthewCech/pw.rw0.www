				<h1>Gamedev PC - Q3 2017</h1>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<h2>THE PC HARDWARE</h2>
			<p>
			A Game Dev PC Build for the third quarter of 2017, with a focus leaning more towards AAA. Please note, this is not designed to exclusively play games and has more of a workstation focus in mind, although a lot of the recommendations are loose on purpose. These recommendations still apply to hackintosh builds fairly well you'll be using an intel CPU if so), tho make sure you tripple-check part compatibiltiy! This entire list was written with a roughtly $2000 budget (after everything) in mind.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;OS:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Immediately set aside $125 for Windows 10. "Just using WINE" won't cut it. If you get it for cheaper, then awesome! Sorry if you like Linux - you're free to use a VM or Dual-boot of course, just realize that most game dev tools are for Windows only. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			4 cores (with 8 threads) is a reasonable minimum. At this moment, brand doesn't matter all too much. Neat processors to check out: From AMD, the Ryzen 1600, the Ryzen 1700(X), and the Ryzen 1800X. From intel, the i7-7700k, the i7-7800X, and the i7-7820X. At the moment, it's mostly just brand preference. The idea of having at least 8 threads is that you're going to be taking on a multithreaded workloads, often simultaneously. This helps keep stuff moving! 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;MOTHERBOARD:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Eh, if it has an M.2 slot that runs at PCIe speeds if you're getting an M.2 Drive, and heat-sinks for the mosfets + chokes (the little black boxes by the CPU) you're fine. You'll probably want USB3 on it too. It's entirely possible to go overboard with a motherboard, never should it exceed the price of the CPU or the price of the GPU.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;RAM:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			At least 2666MHz, At least 16 GB, I don't care what brand. Note: AMD CPUs like 3200+MHz @ 14ms, otherwise it'll clock to 2666MHz unless it's a higher frequency. For AMD: Favor operating frequency. For Intel: Favor timings. More ram helps with having more things open/up at once, and is good for rendering, modeling, and the like.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;GPU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			NVidia GTX 1060 6GB, AMD RX580 8GB, or better. VRAM is your friend. With these as a minimum, your PC will also support VR, no sweat. This is the first part to upgrade in this list if you have the budget available! GPUs help display images and run games, and often are used for advanced rendering or computational tasks.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;STORAGE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			At least 100+ GB SSD that performs well with 4K read/write. Would recommend M.2 SSD: Samsung Evo/Pro 960, or Corsair Force MP 500 series. Refurbished 3TB HDDs go for about $85 USD, so consider that as well. When buying an SSD, consider the kinds of files you're moving. The Read/Write speeds in Megabytes per second usually given assume you're just moving one massive file, whereas the speed of moving a lot of smaller files (4k/8k read/write speeds) are usually measured in IOPS - Input/output operations per second. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;PSU:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Anything with ~200w headroom, 80+. A 600W PSU would be fine for a single-gpu system if rated for 80+ Efficiency, although a 750W will probably be a bit better for system health and your power bill. You want to target a power draw around 50% of the power your supply is rated for to ensure safe operation and to make sure you're operating at the peak of the power efficiency curve, meaning less energy is lost as heat!
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Whatever floats your boat. It should probably fit the motherboard, and will need at least one fan :)
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h2>BEYOND THE BOX</h2>
			<p>
			Your PC setup isn't just the PC itself! It's about making use of the power of your PC. For a full setup, I recommend setting aside around 20-30% of the budget for peripherals. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;MONITOR(S):</h4><br/>
			<p>
			1080p unless you have other reasons for different choices, probably 5ms or less refresh rate. Look for something nice and high-contrast, color accuracy helps- it's hard to go wrong with an IPS display. If you go 4k, GPU must be 1070 8GB at minimum. Can't go too wrong with Asus, Dell, or BenQ, I'm not really a monitor guy but this is something you should consider. I would recommend at least one nice monitor in a setup - However, never underestimate the usefulness of a cheap, pre-owned 1280x1024 monitor added on as an extra bit of work space tho. Do not use a TV as a monitor. A low response time helps a monitor feel snappy, while color-accuracy is very useful for doing design work. IPS displays let you see from an increased viewing angle as well.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;DESK CHAIR:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Oh goodness please get something that doesn't hurt your back and provides back support, if your job is programming this will make a world of difference. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;KEYBOARD/MOUSE:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			You want a decent keyboard. It honestly doesn't matter what, but it's gotta be comfy for YOU. It Doesn't matter if other people don't like its feel, just know that mechanical keyboards can be annoying in shared workspaces if you get lowder switches (MX Blues, Omatu Blues, Razer Greens). The mouse is a similar story as KB in terms of preference - It's gotta work for you. 
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;HEADPHONES:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			Something not dirt cheap and over-ear is key. This helps keep others from bothering you, and makes it possible to experience music and sound properly. There are open-back headphones (you can hear through them and others can sometimes hear your music) and closed-back headphones (block more noise). The sound playback experience is different between the two, and it comes down to preference largely unless you're going for extreme accuracy, in which case you should consult more than just this page for buying. However, I do have some recommendations:
			<br/>
			<br/>
			- AKG 240/M220 or better - Note, these don't block noise well since they're semi-open back, although that may be useful in some cases.
			<br/>
			- Sennheiser HD 201s or better. Hard to find a particularly bad pair of anything more expensive from this company, if you want high-end open-back headphones, then the HD 598s or HD 600s are on point. The 201s tho are good all around.
			<br/>
			- Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones - You basically can't go wrong with these ever. They're durable, and are darn good all around. They have a metal construction so they'll last for a long time. Of the ones listed, probably the one I recommend the most given their reasonable price.
			</p>
			<br/><br/>
			<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;OTHER:</h4><br/>
			<p>
			- A plant. Reminds you that a world exists outside your own, and keeps you company.<br/>
			- Sticky notes. Always good to leave yourself thoughts and scribbles for when you inevitably forget.<br/>
			- Graph paper. Good for anyone in any role!<br/>
			- Pencils/Pens. <br/>
